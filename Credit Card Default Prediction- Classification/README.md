# Credit Card Default Prediction-Classification

Welcome to the Credit Card Default Prediction-Classification project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting credit card default using various machine learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to build a reliable model to classify whether a credit card holder will default on their payment.

## Introduction

Credit card default prediction is crucial for financial institutions to minimize risk and maximize profit. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can develop a model that predicts the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their credit card payment. This project explores different classification algorithms and evaluates their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on credit card clients and their payment behavior. Key features include:

- Client's credit limit
- Previous payment history
- Amount of credit utilized
- Demographic information

## Models and Evaluation

In this project, we experiment with the following classification algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks

The models are evaluated based on several metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms to predict credit card defaults. Through detailed analysis and rigorous evaluation, we identified that Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting models performed the best, offering high accuracy and robustness in predictions. The insights gained from this project can help financial institutions manage credit risk more effectively and make informed decisions. Future work could focus on enhancing the model's performance by incorporating additional features and exploring more advanced machine learning techniques.
